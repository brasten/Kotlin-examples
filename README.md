# Kotlin Samples #

This is a repository for trying out different patterns, styles, and solutions to
problems I encounter frequently in Kotlin projects.

It's not a "best practices" repository; but it probably contains practices I would reach for in
the relevant scenarios.

## Topics ##

### Concurrency / Coroutines / etc ###
In particular, parallel fan-out/fan-in techniques and their gotchas.  

### Pagination ###
